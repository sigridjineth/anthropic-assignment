# Fintech Patterns Skill

## When to Use
- Customer is in fintech/financial services
- Compliance concerns come up
- Questions about regulatory requirements
- Long conversation challenges (common in financial chat)
- Need case studies from similar customers

## Common Fintech Patterns

### Pattern 1: Compliance Concern + Pause
**Signal**: Customer pauses, then mentions compliance
**Example**: "Um, one thing though — we're in fintech, so there's compliance stuff..."
**Response**: Lead with SOC2/audit success stories, show how other fintechs solved it

### Pattern 2: Token Cost + Scale Fear
**Signal**: Growing user base, worried about costs
**Example**: "Our costs are exploding as we scale..."
**Response**: Show ROI of Context Editing, give specific numbers

### Pattern 3: "Claude Forgets"
**Signal**: Users complaining about lost context
**Example**: "By message 15, Claude forgets what we discussed in message 3"
**Response**: Context Editing with persistent facts pattern

## Typical Fintech Requirements

1. **Compliance**: SOC2, GDPR, financial regulations
2. **Audit trails**: Logging all AI decisions
3. **Data residency**: Where data is processed
4. **Long conversations**: Users ask many follow-ups
5. **Accuracy**: Can't give wrong financial advice
