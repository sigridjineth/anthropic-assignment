# Roadmap Skill

## When to Use
- Questions about feature timelines, availability, or release dates
- "When will X be available?"
- "What's on the roadmap?"
- "When is the GA date?"
- "Is feature X in beta or production?"

## Response Guidelines
1. **Always include timeline caveats**: "Timelines are subject to change based on engineering priorities"
2. **Distinguish certainty levels**:
   - Committed (in current sprint): "We're actively working on X, targeting Q1"
   - Planned (in backlog): "X is planned for later this year"
   - Considering (not committed): "We're exploring X, but no timeline yet"
3. **Never over-promise**: When in doubt, be conservative
4. **Offer alternatives**: If a feature isn't available, suggest workarounds

## Safe Messaging Templates

### For committed features:
"[Feature] is currently in development and we're targeting [timeframe]. That said, as with any software development, timelines can shift based on what we learn during implementation."

### For planned features:
"[Feature] is on our roadmap for [timeframe]. While we're committed to this direction, specific timing may adjust as we prioritize based on customer feedback."

### For unplanned features:
"That's valuable feedback. While [feature] isn't currently on our near-term roadmap, I'd love to document this request and connect you with our product team to share your use case."
