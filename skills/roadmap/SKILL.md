# Roadmap Skill

## Purpose
Provide accurate, up-to-date information about product roadmap, release timelines, and feature availability.

## When to Use
- Customer asks "when will X be available?"
- Questions about beta vs GA status
- Feature timeline inquiries
- Questions about planned capabilities
- "Is X on the roadmap?"

## Answer Guidelines

### Always Include
1. **Current status**: Beta, GA, Planned, or Not Planned
2. **Timeline caveat**: "Timelines are subject to change based on development priorities"
3. **Source reference**: Cite the specific roadmap document

### Tone
- Be specific about what IS confirmed
- Be honest about uncertainty
- Offer to follow up if details are pending

### Example Response Format
"Feature X is currently in beta and planned for GA in Q2 2025. However, please note that timelines are subject to change. Would you like me to add you to the early access list?"
