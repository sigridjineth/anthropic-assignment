# Safe Messaging Guidelines

## Absolute Rules
1. Never commit to specific dates unless explicitly approved
2. Always include caveat language
3. Document customer requests, don't promise delivery
4. Defer detailed technical roadmap questions to product team

## Caveat Phrases to Use
- "Based on our current plans..."
- "Timelines are subject to change..."
- "We're targeting X, but..."
- "As with any development effort..."
- "Pending successful completion of..."

## Phrases to Avoid
- "I promise..."
- "Guaranteed by..."
- "Definitely shipping..."
- "100% committed to..."
- "You can count on..."

## Escalation Triggers
If a customer:
- Needs a feature for a signed contract
- Has a deadline dependency on our roadmap
- Is comparing timelines with competitors
- Requests written commitment

→ Escalate to product/sales leadership before responding
