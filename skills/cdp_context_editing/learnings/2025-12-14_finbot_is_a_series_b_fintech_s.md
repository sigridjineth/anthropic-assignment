# Add Example

Fintech compliance + efficiency example: Financial advisor chatbot stores user risk profile, account holdings, and trading constraints in system context. Instead of maintaining full conversation history, use Context Editing to: preserve the compliance-critical preferences section (immutable), prune dated transaction references after 5 turns, and consolidate repeated product recommendations into a single instruction block. This maintains regulatory audit trail while reducing token consumption by ~35%.
