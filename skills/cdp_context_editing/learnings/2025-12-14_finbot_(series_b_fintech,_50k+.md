# Add Pattern

**Token Optimization for Long Financial Conversations**: For conversations exceeding 15 turns, apply context editing to remove non-essential historical exchanges while preserving financial decisions and constraints. Typical approach: compress early negotiation/clarification turns into single abstracted summaries, keep only decisions + constraints in active context. Reduces context window pressure while maintaining compliance-critical decisions.
