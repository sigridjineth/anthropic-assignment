# Add Example

**Long Conversation Compression in Finance**: When conversations exceed 30+ turns, context editing can selectively retain compliance-critical exchanges (exclusion rules, risk assessments) while pruning repetitive or resolved discussions. This extends effective context window and reduces token usage in within-session continuity. Best combined with CDP Memory for cross-session state; context editing optimizes single-session efficiency.
