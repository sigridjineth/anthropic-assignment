# Add Pattern

Fintech long-conversation optimization pattern: For financial advisory chatbots with 20-50 turn conversations, use Context Editing to: (1) prune redundant historical context while preserving compliance-critical user preferences and financial data, (2) consolidate repetitive user instructions into a single optimized system prompt, (3) implement selective context pruning after every 10-15 turns to maintain token budget while preserving decision history. ROI: 30-40% token reduction typical for fintech use cases without accuracy loss.
