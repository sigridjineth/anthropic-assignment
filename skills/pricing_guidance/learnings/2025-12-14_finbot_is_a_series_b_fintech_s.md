# Add Example

Series B Fintech Chatbot ROI Calculation: 50K users with avg 30-turn conversations = ~6M turns/month. At Claude 3.5 Sonnet pricing ($3/$15 per 1M input/output tokens), unoptimized approach: ~180K input tokens/conversation × 50K users = $27K/month. With Context Editing optimization (35% reduction): ~117K input tokens/conversation = $17.5K/month. Monthly savings: ~$9.5K. Annual ROI: $114K savings minus implementation cost. Compliance data retention embedded in context strategy reduces need for separate vector DB layer.
