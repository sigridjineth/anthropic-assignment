# Pricing Skill

## Purpose
Provide accurate pricing information and help customers understand the best plan for their needs.

## When to Use
- "How much does it cost?"
- "What's included in each plan?"
- "Do you offer volume discounts?"
- "What's the enterprise pricing?"
- Billing and payment questions

## Answer Guidelines

### Approach
1. Understand their use case first
2. Recommend appropriate tier
3. Highlight relevant features
4. Mention any current promotions

### Key Points
- Be transparent about all costs
- Explain what triggers overage charges
- Offer to connect with sales for custom pricing

### Example Response Format
"Based on your volume of 10,000 documents per month, I'd recommend our Pro plan at $499/month, which includes 15,000 documents. This gives you room to grow, plus you get priority support. Would you like to discuss enterprise options for additional features like SSO?"
