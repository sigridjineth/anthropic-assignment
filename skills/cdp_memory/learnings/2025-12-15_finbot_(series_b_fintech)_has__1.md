# Add Example

**FinBot (Series B, 50K+ retail investors)**: AI financial advisor chatbot with 20-50 turn conversations. Pain point: token costs spike linearly with conversation length; users forget constraints across days. Solution: CDP Memory stores user preferences (e.g., 'exclude oil stocks', risk tolerance) as compressed state between sessions. Expected ROI: 30-40% reduction in tokens per session by eliminating context re-explanation; improved UX (users don't re-state constraints). Compliance benefit: critical investment rules now persist reliably.
