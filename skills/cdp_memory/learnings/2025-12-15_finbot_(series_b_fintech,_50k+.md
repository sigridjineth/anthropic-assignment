# Add Pattern

Financial advisor chatbot use case: Users expect 20+ hour context preservation across multi-day sessions. Memory enables storing financial context (transaction history, risk profile, previous recommendations) without repeating in each conversation. Combined with Context Editing, reduces token usage by ~40% on resumed conversations by eliminating redundant context restatement.
