# Add Pattern

**Multi-turn Financial Advisor Pattern**: For fintech chatbots with 20-50 turn conversations, use Memory API to persist compliance-critical state (investment restrictions, user preferences, risk profiles) rather than re-contextualizing in every turn. Expected outcome: 30-40% token reduction while maintaining regulatory compliance. Example: Store user's 'no crypto investments' preference in memory instead of re-stating it in system prompt every turn.
