# Add Pattern

**Retail Finance Multi-Session Pattern**: Users of AI financial advisor chatbots expect persistent memory of investment preferences, constraints, and exclusion filters across days. Critical for compliance (e.g., 'no oil stocks', sector exclusions). Each new session without memory forces users to re-state constraints, increasing friction and compliance risk. CDP Memory solves this by storing compressed user state between sessions, reducing token spend in long-running conversations while preserving compliance-critical data.
